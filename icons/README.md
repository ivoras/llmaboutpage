# Extension Icons

To generate the required icons:

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in a web browser
2. The icons will be automatically generated and downloaded
3. Ensure the following files are in this directory:
   - `icon-16.png`
   - `icon-48.png`
   - `icon-128.png`

Alternatively, you can create simple colored square icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels) with "LLM" text or any design you prefer.
